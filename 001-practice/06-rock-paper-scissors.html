    <!--The idea behind the rock paper scissors game is to use Math.random to pick a number, then to convert that  number into either rock, paper or scissors-->
    <button onclick="
      const randomNumber = Math.random(); 
      if (randomNumber <= 1/3) { // here the imput for rock is if the randomNumber is less the one third.
        alert('You both picked rock! Tie !');
        numberTied++;
      } else if (randomNumber > 1/3 && randomNumber <= 2/3) { // same for scissors
        alert('You picked rock! The computer picked paper! You loose!');
        numberLost++;
      } else if (randomNumber > 2/3) { // and for paper
        alert('You picked rock! The computer picked scissors! You win');
        numberWon++; }
      //console.log(`Picked rock (< 1/3) ${randomNumber}`); // this is just to confirm that the code is actually working, this outputs the randomNumber to the console so we can confirm
    ">Rock</button>

    <button onclick="
    const randomNumberPaper = Math.random(); // this section works the same way with one minor difference. because the user selected paper, the scenarios in which the user wins are changed. Also note that for the sake of simplicity, any time randomNumber pickes a number less then one third, for example, it will be rock, this could be adjusted, but that would lead to confusion.
    if (randomNumberPaper <= 1/3) {
      alert('You pick paper! The computer picked rock! You win!');
      numberWon++;
    } else if (randomNumberPaper > 1/3 && randomNumberPaper <= 2/3) {

<!--This method of building this game was my idea, I didn't nessesarily think of it first, but I didn't recieve any inspiration. Hence why the code is not the neatest. A better appraoch I have learned was to output the player move, and computer move in a variable and then compare the two and create an alert. However I am still please with a functional project.-->

   <button onclick="
    console.log(` Number of wins: ${numberWon} \nNumber of losses: ${numberLost} \nNumber of ties: ${numberTied}`); // this code just outputs the number of wins, losses and ties to the console, primarily for testing purposes, will probably coomment out later.
