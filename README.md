## Intro:
This is my learning page, as my "projects" are barely even that, I think it is a bad descicion to make them public. That being said I want to still get used to using GitHub.

The main two projects are my rock paper scissors game and a todo list.

I roughly followed this series.

I say roughly because most of the projects I attempted to and more or less completed with minimal assistance from the video. I however did teach me a lot. This is a great reasource for 0 to something, however notable exemptions include test driven development and interaction with git.
